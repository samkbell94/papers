# Abstract
This is the only thing 90% of people will read.

# Introduction
Haywood et al (1999) made some great measurments of BBOA over the Sahara. We add to these measurements, with chemical composition data, using an aerosol mass spectrometer (Allen et al 2000). 

# Simulations
John has made some simulations of particle formation using his box model. It reproduces the growth in size distribution observed and suggest coagulation as the dominant method of growth.

# Methodology
We used an AMS (Allen et al 1999) to measure particle mass andd chemical composition. 


# Results
We observed partical grwoth through coagulation and report the changing chemical composition with ages in the atmosphere. 


# Conclusions
We made some ground breaking discovery! Look at all this future work...

# Figures
This is where the pretty picutres go.
