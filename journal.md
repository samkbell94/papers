#Introduction
Haywood et al (1999) made some great measurments of BBOA over the Sahara. We add to these measurements, with chemical composition data, using an aerosol mass spectrometer (Allen et al 2000). 

#Simulations
John has made some simulations of particle formation using his box model. It reproduces the growth in size distribution observed and suggest coagulation as the dominant method of growth.
